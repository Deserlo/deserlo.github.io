							<p>Using Python, Selenium, and the BeautifulSoup library, I developed web scrapers to pick music event listings
							from various websites which saves the data to flat files. It uses Selenium, a testing automation framework, to extract the data
							from dynamic pages.  I added complex logic with the utilization of the Youtube API which is used to search for a music video
							of the event artist.  I designed and hand-coded the front-end of the website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript maintaining
							the responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.  My webserver executes a Python script daily to update the 
							listings which writes to static files but new listings need to be added through manual execution of the scraping scripts.</p>
							
							<p><i><strong>Currently redesigning and implementing a new UI while also migrating to a Flask app. New web app currently
								deployed on Heroku for staging while in development.<i></strong></p>

							<a href="https://github.com/Deserlo/Legend" target="_blank"><h3>NodeJS Web Application</h3></a>
							<p>My senior project team and I built a web application for a small, local martial arts studio in Rocklin, Ca. 
							Our tech stack included Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and jQuery. The business had an existing website but was in need of a better
							UI design and some additional featues such as  registered accounts, taking student attendance, and tracking progress. </p>
							
							<p>As a main contributor to this project, major responsibilties were in the backend and included setting up an automated build using Heroku to deploy once any commmits were pushed to our master branch,
							designing the database schema, and developing the application structure to achieve high-cohesiveness and loose coupling between the modules.</p>
							
							<p>Also, I effectively used jQuery to render the data on the front-end from our back-end. </p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Deserlo/global-geothermal-power-visualization" target="_blank"><h3>Geothermal Data Visualization</h3></a>
				<p>As part of a data visualization course, I picked a dataset on a topic of interest to further tell a story through the
				use of D3, a powerful Javascript library.  I used a bubble chart as I thought it might be inviting for interaction and
				further exploration.  Tooltips were used to give the user details-on-demand.
				My project was one of few to be picked by my professor to demo at a school event.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Deserlo/S3T6TM2" target="_blank"><h3>Project/Task Management Application</h3></a>
				<p>Using agile methodology, my team developed a Java based task management application. This app was developed
				as part of a software engineering course and each team implemented their own features. Other technologies included MySQL
				and Java Swift for the front-end and the app was developed using object-oriented programming. 
				I contributed to the back-end where I designed the relational database schema, developed sql queries, and created the classes.
